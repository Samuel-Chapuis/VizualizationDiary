# A Visualization Critique Diary
This is a long-term assignment that you conduct throughout the course.

**Week 3 - 15**
## Task
Each week, you document and 1 visualization you encounter in the wild (news, social media, research papers, museums, an app, etc.). The goal of this assignment is to train your data visualization literacy skills and awareness of how visualizations may have been purposefully created. 

To do so you create a google spreadsheet with one entry per slide.

Each entry should 
Include the visualization (or a screenshot/photo, cited with source and date).
- Describe how you found the visualization and why you picked it (no elaborate rationale is needed. If it grabbed your attention for a certain reason that’s ok)
- Describe what the visualization shows and the context in which it appeared.
- Analyze how visual design choices affect interpretation.
- Suggest how it could be improved for a specific audience or purpose. You may add quick sketch if you want. 

Example of the layout for one page:

> How I found the visualization (& why I picked it)  
> The visualization was suggested to me on my Facebook feed and I found it quite difficult to decipher and wanted to dig a bit deeper into why it seemed difficult.
> 
> What this visualization shows  
> The proportion of European universities ranked in the 100 best universities worldwide according to the World University Rankings (2021-2025). The visualization uses a horizon graph with percentages visualized using a sequential color scale and rankings on the horizontal axis.
> 
> Context  
> The visualization was published next to a short explanatory text on Instagram by the data visualization lead (Sebastian Gräff) of “The European Correspondent”. The explanation mentions that Europe has top universities in Arts and Humanities but fewer in Computer Science and Engineering.
> 
> Design choices  
> The chart is very difficult to interpret for multiple reasons. First, horizon graphs are not a well-known technique and hard to interpret. Second, rankings are not continuous data although the smooth interpolation suggests as such. It is very hard to decipher how many universities are really in which ranking position. Personally, I was first misled to think that higher=better when this is in fact, the inverse. On the positive side, some annotations help to interpret the data.
> 
> Improvements  
> If we want to stay with the compact format that caters to phone-based Instagram viewing, a bar-chart encoding might work well. Alternatively a stripe-plot (also called scarf plot) could be used. I would also add summary statistics on the right (% of universities that are European in each category). Finally, it should be considered to make the visualization vertical to avoid confusion where 1 as the best ranking is at the top.




## Detailed Instructions

### 1. Find your visualization
Choose one visualization every week (13 in total)
You must have personally encountered it (e.g., in your reading, research, daily life). Avoid examples from visualization textbooks or class materials or a dedicated google search for it.
Aim for diversity: e.g., news graphic, scientific figure, dashboard, infographic, public signage, etc.. Find examples that matter to you or that grab your interest.


### 2. Describe
For each of the four points above add a few sentences. Complete entries should be around 300 words in total each. 
### 3. Analyze
For your critique you can also keep in mind who the visualization might have been intended for and discuss if it works for this audience.  Critically discuss at least three of the following aspects:




| Aspect | Guiding questions |
|---|---|
| Encoding choices & Clarity | How are variables mapped to visual properties (position, color, size)? Are these mappings perceptually effective? |
| Clarity and readability | What helps or hinders understanding? Is labeling adequate? |
| Narrative / message | What story or argument is implied by the design? |
| Ethics and bias | Is there evidence of misleading scales, missing data, or framing bias? |
| Aesthetics and emotion |How does visual style influence tone or credibility?|
| Context and audience fit| Is the design appropriate for its medium and audience?|

## Grading Rubric



| Aspect | Explication | Points |
|---|---|---|
|Selection|Diversity, relevance, and originality of selected examples. From credible sources. Excellent examples go beyond common sources.| 20 pts|
|Analytics| Insightful, specific critique using course vocabulary. Connections between design, perception, understanding.| 20 pts|
| Redesign reflection | Thoughtful redesign ideas that show rationale for choices made. Excellent examples include simple redesign sketches. |20 pts |
| Clarity|Diary is clear, visually coherent, and easy to follow. Submission follows all requirements and presents materials neatly |20 pts |

You may use tools to help you organize or check the grammar of your writing, but **the critique must reflect your own visual judgment**. AI-generated responses will not capture your perspective — and will score poorly.
